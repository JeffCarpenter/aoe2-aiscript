## 1. Overview 

Age of Empires was one of those hit games from the late 90s/ early 2000s that had a neat AI system. We considered the fact that its expert system could possibly be a scripting language. In that case, we decided to make a VS Code extension that would bring joy to AoE II content creators (specifically AI makers) anywhere. If you are reading this, then you have installed that extension.

## 2. Features
 
 ### 2.1 Rule Counter
 
 The Rule Counter is a neat visual on the right side of your status bar in which will display the number of rules (indicated by an opening parenthesis followed by "defrule") in your AI script.

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## 3. Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## 4. Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## 5. Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.
