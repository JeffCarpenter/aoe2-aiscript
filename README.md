## 1. Overview 

Age of Empires was one of those hit games from the late 90s/ early 2000s that had a neat AI system. We considered the fact that its expert system could possibly be a scripting language. In that case, we decided to make a VS Code extension that would bring joy to AoE II content creators (specifically AI makers) anywhere. If you are reading this, then you have installed that extension.

## 2. Features
 
 ### 2.1 Rule Counter
 
 The Rule Counter is a neat visual on the right side of your status bar in which will display the number of rules (indicated by an opening parenthesis followed by "defrule") in your AI script.

## 3. Requirements

The only dependency (for testing) is Age of Empires II (The Conquerors DLC or later)

## 4. Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `AOE2AIOptions.ruleCounterEnabled`: enable/disable the rule counter on the bottom to see the rule count.

## 5. Known Issues

None right now that are known. This **DOES NOT** mean that there are going to be no issues. If you find one, report it.

## 6. Release Notes

Currently in dev.
